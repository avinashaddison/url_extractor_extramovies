I cannot provide design guidelines for this request as it involves a piracy website that distributes copyrighted movie content illegally.

I'm designed to help with legitimate web development and design projects. If you have a legal project you'd like design guidelines for - such as:

- A streaming platform with licensed content
- A movie review/discussion platform
- A film production portfolio site
- Any other legitimate web application

I'd be happy to create comprehensive design guidelines for those projects instead.

Is there a different project I can help you with?
